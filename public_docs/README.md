# Public Docs

This folder is the public-facing documentation surface for `tastemaker-programs`.

- Put externally shareable runbooks/guides here.
- Keep internal operating notes and team-specific workflows in `docs/`.
- Do not edit internal docs when preparing public docs; maintain them separately.
