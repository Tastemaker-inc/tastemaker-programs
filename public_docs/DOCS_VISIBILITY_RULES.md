# Docs Visibility Rules

- `docs/` = internal team docs (operational/internal workflow source of truth).
- `public_docs/` = public-facing docs for external contributors.
- Do not merge or overwrite internal docs when editing public docs.
- If both versions exist for the same topic, update them independently.
