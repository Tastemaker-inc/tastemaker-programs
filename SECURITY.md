# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security vulnerabilities to **security@tastemaker.music**. Do not open public GitHub issues for security-sensitive bugs.

### Scope

We are interested in vulnerabilities in the **on-chain Anchor programs** in this repository:

- `taste_token`
- `project_escrow`
- `governance`
- `rwa_token`

**Out of scope:** Test files, documentation, CI configuration, and tooling outside these programs.

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment:** Within 48 hours
- **Triage:** Within 7 days
- **Coordinated disclosure:** We ask for up to 90 days to address the issue before public disclosure, so we can fix and deploy before details are shared publicly.

### Safe Harbor

We support safe harbor for security researchers who make good-faith efforts to follow this policy. We will not pursue legal action against or ask law enforcement to investigate researchers who:

- Report vulnerabilities in good faith
- Avoid privacy violations, destruction of data, and disruption of services
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate it

### What We Will Do

We will work with you to understand and fix the issue, and we will credit you in any advisory (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).

We do not currently run a bug bounty program; there is no monetary reward, but we appreciate responsible disclosure.
